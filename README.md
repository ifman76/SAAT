## Overview
"This repository contains all the code, data, and other materials related to the reproducible research results of the paper titled [SAAT]. The paper was written by [Youngmin, CHO] and submitted to [Computers & Security]."

## Introduction
The aim of this study is to develop a tool that can measure the security awareness level of individuals, whether they are employees of organizations or general individuals, at any time and place. To achieve this, we design and implement a new security awareness measurement metric, enabling easy assessment of individual security levels. This, in turn, supports the operation of more effective security policies and educational programs.
